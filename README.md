After downloading/cloning the repo
- rename `server/.env.example` to `.env`
- in the `.env` file, change `"MONGO URL String"` to the string from my email

Open two terminals, one for the server, and one for the client
- open a terminal in the server directory 
- run `npm install` in the server directory
- open a terminal in the client directory
- run `npm install` in the client directory

Once all installations are complete:
- run `npm start` in the server directory
- run `npm start` in the client directory
- access the page from `localhost:3000`

App should be similar to what is displayed here.
